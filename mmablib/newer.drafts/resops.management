Managing the resops class:

Resops itself
  Declare a base class resops (inheriting from metricgrid)
  Provide the required locate functions returning nulls, as there
    cannot be any direct resop class, but metricgrid will insist.
  Virtual function locate(ijpt, lat, lon), etc. -- require the
    descendants to have these classes.
 
In any descendant class:
  Provide lat, lon, dlatdi, dlondi, dlatdj, dlondj, jacob;
  include a protected static int count
  Make these static within the descendant (problematic within families,
    but at least distinguishes between families) 
  Inline calls from the mandatory metricgrid locates to the resops 
     versions (with appropriate args)
