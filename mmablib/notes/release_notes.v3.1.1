Remove cfs.bin* files -- binary files for the COFS model.  
Remove cofs.h         -- class for COFS model
COFS model was retired from operations in 2006.  Fields archived
elsewhere.

Update include files from, e.g., string.h to more-correct for c++ cstring.

Update make scripts to leave libraries in current working directory rather
than relative path, per request from SPA Valerie.
